# theme DataBase Documentation

AtEase is a mobile application that deals with stress. The primary goal of the app is to help Gen Z manage their stress. Key to any
A protection strategy is knowledge of the monitoring and the various uses of those monitors. Management decisions need to be based on information of the system. While there may be many efforts to monitor, study, and manage individual portions of their stress, a system-wide overview of the information available is essential for the management of the AtEase as a whole unit. Collecting all of the
disparate information and compiling it into one easily accessible database is the goal of the Regional Environmental Information
System (REIS). The design of the database is based on the information that is to be collected or that will be collected.


# theme 2. SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS


 Following reviews of the data that would be entered into the database, and the requirements of retrieving the data several criteria
 Have identified that need to be met by the database software. The minimum requirements for the software were:
1. Must support the relational database model and some version of the SQL language. This is an        
  industry-standard, and as
  a program that will be spanning several countries and many years adhering to this standard will ensure the longevity and
  portability of the database. In addition, most database administrators are familiar with some form of SQL and relational databases, so training an administrator will be relatively easy.

2. Need to allow multiple users to access tables simultaneously. Since the data is going to be  
   entered by users from 
4. countries and numerous agencies, it is likely that multiple people will be entering data into the    
   same table at the same time.

3. Allow running of stored SQL scripts. There are many processes that can be automated with stored   
   scripts, to facility management, updates, editing, and querying of the 
   database. This is especially important if users are accessing the data from the internet. 
   Being able to call and run a stored script is far easier and more efficient than trying to code all the information into a web form.

4. Allow restrictions on the data values entered in columns within a table. Being able to restrict the   
   data to certain ranges or values will reduce the possible errors in data entry.

5. Allow creation of multiple indexes on a table, as well as unique indexes within a table. Also must be 
   able to create one
   index on multiple columns. Multiple indexes on a table allow faster sorts and queries based on various parameters.
   Creating a unique index across multiple columns will prevent entering duplicate data. 


# Requirenment Documentation

Requirement documentation: is needed from the product It states the product's purpose and what it must achieve. It does not define how to deliver or build what is needed.

Great products are built from great plans. They require research, a comprehensive strategy, and a roadmap. Defined and documented requirements are a key part of the process for the development of a new or complex system. To ensure the product meets users’ needs, it needs to be understood, captured and agreed upon. Knowing what is required and communicating it in a clear way is a critical part of any new project.
Requirements help communicate and define customer needs and problems. Through requirements gathering, stakeholders can establish a consensus on what is needed for customers’ problems to be solved. The process also can provide a basis for estimates, timelines, and, if used effectively, help prevent failures. The benefits include:

Alignment: Consensus and agreement among stakeholders.
Preparation: More accurate estimates for budgets and timelines.
Direction: Information for design, development, QA, or vendor teams.
Efficiency: A defined plan before starting design and code work.
Productivity: Less rework and Scope screen.

# theme:Product Requirenment Documentation

It's a document containing all the requirements for a certain product.

 Why we need to use it on our project / it's important because:

Background/History - allow people to understand aspects of the project.
User Requirements (the abilities that the users need) for example in Sign Up/Login Screen accepts personal information e.g Name, email address,  phone number.
Stakeholder and User Analysis - This can help a project to identify who may affect or be affected by the problem.




# theme PROCESS DOCUMENTATION
Process documentaion is important to our project because it gives team members room to be assigned and execute tasks.

It also helps to enhance consistency in a way that,a process doesn't have to be re-designed each time and is always created using the same logic

Enable process improvement; Examining the details within process documents can highlight bottlenecks and areas that could be made more efficient.

# theme User Guide /Manual
What is the user manual- it’s a complete guide to every aspect of your app for example phone that answered every question you could ever ask.
Guidelines to help make instructions easy on the user.

Provide step-by-step sequences in the correct order.
Follow the timing and sequencing of the actual operations.
Provide visual stepping stones (e.g. Step 1, Step 2, step3 till the end of the project )
Avoid lengthy paragraphs.
Use everyday words and terms: avoid jargon(unnecessarily complicated language used to impress)

How to Write a User Manual that is simple
Step 1: Identify the Audience. ( The specific group of consumers most likely to want your product or service.) 
 Step 2: Define the Purpose of the Manual.
Step 3: Identify the How-To Steps. 
Step 4: Formalize the Written Steps. 
Step 5: Develop Appropriate Graphics. ( Choose a background, tools to be used)
Step 6: Write Other Sections of the Manual. ( the front manner, the body, and the back matter. The front matter contains the title page, scope section, warnings and cautions as well as a table of contents)
Step 9: Proofread Carefully. (carefully checking for errors in a text before it is published or shared)
